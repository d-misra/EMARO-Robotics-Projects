# Robotic projects
This repository contains some of lab assignments and project submissions prepared as part of the EMARO+ (2016-18) coursework https://master-emaro.ec-nantes.fr/curriculum/. 

The first two semesters were completed at Warsaw University of Technology (WUT) and the third semester was covered at Ecole Centrale de Nantes (ECN). My masters thesis internship in the final semester, was carried out with the Resibots team in INRIA, Nancy.

## Topics of reports 

### WUT :
- Mobile robot navigation and path planning algorithms
- Line-follower robot using microcontrollers
- Frequency based filtering in signal processing
- Dining philoshopher's problem
- Pick and place programming for 5-dof arm
- Optimization of production planning

### ECN :
- Autonomous platooning
- Kalman Filtering for position and speed estimation
- Optimal placement and kinematic design of a SCARA robot
- Optimization of a welding task
- Augmented reality using visual odometry
- Kinematic analysis of 3RRR planar parallel robot

### Master-Thesis
**Title** : Learning to grasp with a jamming gripper using the Black-DROPS algorithm. 

**Brief overview** : A data-efficient reinforcement learning algorithm based on a model-based policy search approach (Black-DROPS https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07261), that uses Gaussian Processes for modelling the uncertain system transition dynamics and noisy black-box function optimizers (CMA-ES) for policy search, is applied for a robotic grasping task. The setup consists of a versaball gripper fit on a 5-dof manipulator. RGBD cameras (Xtion3) are used for the object detection purpose.
